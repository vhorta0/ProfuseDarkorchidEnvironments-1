# String Practice:

# Create a Python program that asks the user to input a sentence.
sentence = input("Type a sentence. ")
# Print the first and last letter of the sentence.
print(sentence[0])
print(sentence[12])
# Convert the entire sentence to uppercase and print the result.
print(sentence.upper())
# Find and print a substring from the inputted sentence.
print(sentence[2:6])
# Replace a word in the sentence and print the updated sentence.
print(sentence.replace("die", "live"))

# Input Practice:

# Create a Python program that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite movie.
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
movie = input("What is your favorite movie? ")
# Print a message back to the user with this information.
print(f"{name} is {age} years old and their favorite movie is {movie}")
# Note: Make sure to convert the age to an integer.

# F-String Practice:

# Create a Python program that asks the user for three objects in the room.
object = input("What is 1 thing in your room? ")
object2 = input("What is another obejct in your room? ")
object3 = input("What is one final thing in your room? ")
# Create variables from these objects and insert those variables into an f-string sentence.
# Print the f-string sentence.
print(f"In {name}'s room there are {object}, {object2}, and {object3}.")

# Advanced String Practice:

# Create a Python program that asks the user for the name of their favorite book, movie, and song.
book = input("What is your favorite book? ")
movie2 = input("What is your favorite movie? ")
song = input("What is your favorite song? ")

# Print a message that says, "Your favorite book is [Book], your favorite movie is [Movie], and your favorite song is [Song]."
print(
    f"Your favorite book is {book}, your favorite movie is {movie2}, and your favorite song is {song}."
)

# Advanced F-String Practice:

# Create a Python program that asks the user for their name, age, and the current year.
name2 = input("What is your name? ")
age2 = input("How old are you? ")
year = input("What year is is? ")
year2 = 2007
# Use f-strings to print a message like: "Hello [Your Name], you were born in [Current Year - Your Age]."
print(f"Hello {name2}, you were born in {year2}.")

# Type Conversion Practice:

# Create a Python program that asks the user for two numbers.
num1 = int(input("What is your first number? "))
num2 = int(input("What is your second number? "))
# Print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.
print(num1 + num2)
print(num1 - num2)
print(num1 * num2)
print(num1 / num2)
# Note: Make sure to convert the input to integers before performing any calculations.

# Summary Challenge:

# Find a summary of a movie online and create a variable called movie_summary and store the summary in this variable.
movie_summary = "The Machine Girl, is a 2008 Japanese action comedy film written and directed by Noboru Iguchi, and starring Minase Yashiro, Asami, Kentar≈ç Shimazu and Honoka. The plot follows an orphaned Japanese schoolgirl whose life is destroyed when her brother is killed by a son of a Ninja-Yakuza clan. When her hand is cut off, she replaces it with a makeshift machine gun and seeks revenge."
# Print the length of the summary.
print(len(movie_summary))
# Uppercase the entire summary and print it.
print(movie_summary.upper())
# Replace a word in the summary and print the updated summary.
print(movie_summary.replace("film", "movie"))
# Print the last word of the summary.
print(movie_summary[373:380])

# Real Challenge:

# Create a Python program that asks the user for their first and last name, their age, and their favorite color.
full = input("What is your full name? ")
ano = input("What is your age? ")
color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
# Using f-strings, print a message that says, "Hello [First Name] [Last Name], you are [Age] years old and your favorite color is [Favorite Color]."
print(
    f"Hello {full}, you are {ano} years old and your favorite color is {color}."
)
